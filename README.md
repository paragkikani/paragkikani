<h3 align="center"> About Me</h3>

> I am an innovative game programmer with over 7+ years of experience in the
gaming industry. I specialize in building various types of games using the Unity
editor. Enjoying playing games and fixing bugs, game development is not just a job
but a passion for me. I started as an Android developer, later transitioning to become
a skilled game developer through Udemy and YouTube courses. I began my career at
Dignizant Technology, later moved to BVM Infotech, and have been freelancing for
the past year.
