## Professional Summary

I am an innovative game programmer with over 6+ years of experience in the gaming industry. I build all types of games using the Unity editor. It's fun for me to play games and find bugs that need to be fixed. Game development is something I enjoy. As a member of a team and as an individual, I worked together. I began my programming career as an Android developer. A 1.5-year period later, I realized I would be able to become a good game developer. In order to learn from Unity games, I show Udemy and YouTube courses. By the end of the third month, I had built my first Unity game. After that, I joined Dignizant Technology as a Unity Developer. After 3 year i changed jobs to BVM Infotech Learn working in a team. After 2 Year i found a client for Hyper Casual games. Last year I worked as a freelancer till now.
